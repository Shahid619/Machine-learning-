        "Splitting the data into training and testing sets is a fundamental step in machine learning to evaluate the performance of your model. Let's break down the logic behind this step and address your questions:\n",

        "        This line of code is using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn to split your dataset into two parts: a training set and a testing (or validation) set.\n",
        "\n",
        "        X contains your feature data (the measurements), and y contains the target labels (the species of iris in the case of the Iris dataset).\n",
        "\n",
        "        test_size=0.3 specifies that you want to allocate 30% of your data to the testing set, while the remaining 70% will be used for training. The test_size parameter allows you to control the size of the testing set.\n",
        "\n",
        "        random_state=42 sets the random seed for the randomization process. This ensures that the data split is reproducible. Using the same random seed (42 in this case) will result in the same data split each time you run the code. Reproducibility is essential for consistent results and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Logic Behind Splitting:\n",
        "\n",
        "    The purpose of splitting the data is to evaluate how well your machine learning model generalizes to unseen data. By training the model on one part of the data (the training set) and testing it on another part (the testing set), you can estimate how well it will perform on new, unseen data in the real world.\n",
        "\n",
        "    The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance. This helps you assess whether your model is overfitting (performing well on the training data but poorly on new data) or underfitting (performing poorly on both training and new data).\n",
        "\n",
        "    The goal is to strike a balance between training and testing data. Too little training data can result in an underfit model, while too little testing data can lead to unreliable performance estimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Variable Names:\n",
        "\n",
        "    You can replace the variable names like test_size and random_state with other names if you prefer. Variable names in code are used for readability and understanding, so it's good practice to choose meaningful and descriptive names. However, it's essential to ensure that the variable names you choose are consistent with their usage in the function call.\n",
